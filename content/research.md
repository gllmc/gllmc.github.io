Here is an overview of the research projects I have been involved in.

## Computable analysis and learning theory (2024-2026)

I am working with Vasco Brattka on the study of uniform computability properties of PAC learning, a collaboration initiated during my internship at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich in Spring 2025. We are using computable analysis and Weihrauch reducibility to characterize the degree of constructivity of several versions of the fundamental theorem of statistical learning. We have submitted [a preprint of our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18663) in January 2026.

You can also find the associated [internship report](https://media.chirache.fr/research/Internship_report_UniBw_Guillaume_Chirache.pdf) and [defense slides](https://media.chirache.fr/research/Internship_presentation_UniBw_Guillaume_Chirache.pdf). Before the internship, I was introduced to computable analysis by Olivier Bournez, whom I did a research project with during the academic year 2024-2025. Its goal was to understand the work of Akitoshi Kawamura and Stephen Cook on the definition of complexity classes for problems in computable analysis.

## Post-quantum password-authenticated key exchange (2023-2024)

As part of École Polytechnique’s second-year collective scientific project (PSC) and under the supervision of Mélissa Rossi, researcher at the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), I worked with four other students on the implementation of CAKE, a post-quantum Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol. Most documents are in French:

- [Page publique](https://media.chirache.fr/research/INF08_Page_publique.pdf)
- [Rapport final](https://media.chirache.fr/research/INF08_Rapport_final.pdf)
- [Transparents pour la soutenance](https://media.chirache.fr/research/INF08_Soutenance.pdf)
- [Code repository](https://github.com/pq-pake)

The project was nominated for École polytechnique’s best collective scientific project award. This project took place before I studied cryptography, and it essentially focused on implementation and benchmarking rather than on the design of the protocol and the security analysis.

## Encoding of term rewriting in the Pi-calculus (2021)

My first research internship, between my second and third years of Bachelor’s, was supervised by Romain Demangeon at LIP6. It focused on encoding rewriting rules over term algebras into the Pi-calculus. Here is the [report](https://media.chirache.fr/research/Rapport_stage_LIP6_Guillaume_Chirache.pdf) (in French).
